# Map Click & Route Display Feature

## Overview
The GoogleMapView component now supports instant route display when clicking on the map. When a user clicks anywhere on the map, the following happens automatically:

1. **A red marker is placed** at the clicked location with a drop animation
2. **Route is calculated immediately** from the current location to the clicked point
3. **The route line is drawn** on the map with transport mode-specific colors
4. **An info window appears** showing distance, duration, and address details

## Features

### Visual Elements

#### Destination Marker
- Large red pin marker with white center
- Drop animation when placed
- Bounce animation for 1.5 seconds to draw attention
- Shows destination name and address on hover

#### Route Line
- Color-coded by transport mode:
  - 🚗 **Driving**: Blue (#1E40AF)
  - 🚶 **Walking**: Green (#059669)
  - 🚴 **Cycling**: Red (#DC2626)
  - 🚌 **Transit**: Purple (#7C3AED)
- Line thickness varies (walking routes are thinner)
- High opacity for visibility

#### Info Window
- Automatically appears after route calculation
- Shows:
  - Location name
  - Full address
  - Distance to destination
  - Estimated travel time
  - Current transport mode
- Auto-closes after 7 seconds

### User Experience Flow

1. **Click on Map**
   - Marker appears immediately
   - Loading toast shows "📍 Calculating [mode] route..."
   
2. **Route Calculation**
   - Happens automatically in background
   - Uses current transport mode (driving, walking, cycling, transit)
   
3. **Route Display**
   - Blue/green/red/purple line appears on map
   - Map zooms to fit entire route
   - Success toast shows route details
   
4. **Address Resolution**
   - Initially shows "Getting address..."
   - Updates with real address once geocoding completes
   - Info window updates with final address

## Usage Example

```tsx
<GoogleMapView
  currentLocation={userLocation}
  selectedLocation={destination}
  route={routeData}
  transportMode="driving"
  isNavigating={false}
  onLocationSelect={(location) => {
    console.log('User selected:', location);
  }}
  onRouteRequest={(from, to) => {
    console.log('Route requested from', from, 'to', to);
  }}
  onRouteCalculated={(directionsResult) => {
    console.log('Route calculated:', directionsResult);
  }}
  onMapReady={(map) => {
    console.log('Map is ready');
  }}
/>
```

## Transport Modes

The route calculation respects the current transport mode:

- **Driving** 🚗: Fastest route by car
- **Walking** 🚶: Pedestrian paths and sidewalks
- **Cycling** 🚴: Bike-friendly routes, avoids highways
- **Transit** 🚌: Public transportation options

## Error Handling

- If GPS is disabled: Shows message "📍 Enable GPS to get directions to this location"
- If route calculation fails: Shows error toast with reason
- If geocoding fails: Falls back to coordinates display
- Automatic retry with diagnostics if route doesn't display

## Clearing Routes

Users can clear the current route by:
- Double-clicking on the map
- Clicking the "Clear Route" button (if available)
- Selecting a new destination
