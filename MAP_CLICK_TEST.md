# 🗺️ Map Click & Route Testing Guide

Your Findy app now supports **clicking anywhere on the map** to get fast directions! Here's how to test it:

## 🎯 **How to Use:**

### 1. **Open the App**
- Go to: http://localhost:3000
- Wait for the Google Map to load
- Make sure location services are enabled

### 2. **Click Anywhere on the Map**
- **Simple**: Just click any point on the map
- **Auto-magic**: The app will:
  - 🔍 Find the address of where you clicked
  - 🧭 Calculate the fastest route from your location
  - 📍 Show a green marker at the destination
  - 🛣️ Display the route on the map

### 3. **Interactive Route Options**
After clicking, you'll see:
- **Place name and address** (from reverse geocoding)
- **Route calculation progress** indicator
- **"Start Navigation"** button to begin turn-by-turn
- **"Details"** button for more place info
- **Close (X)** button to cancel

## 🧪 **Test These Scenarios:**

### Basic Tests:
1. **Click on a building** → Should show address and route
2. **Click on a street** → Should show street name and route  
3. **Click on a park** → Should show park name and route
4. **Click far away** → Should calculate longer route

### Advanced Tests:
1. **Change transport mode** (car/walk/bike) → Route should update
2. **Click multiple places** → Previous markers should be replaced
3. **Close route popup** → Markers and route should disappear
